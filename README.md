# 🛡️ XSS Lab – Safe & Vulnerable Scenarios

This is a mini XSS Lab demonstrating **both vulnerable and secure implementations** of two common types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:
- ✅ Reflected XSS
- ✅ Stored XSS

You can use this project as a **practice tool** or demo when learning or teaching web security.

## 🚀 Features

- 💡 Two vulnerable endpoints (`reflected_vuln.php` and `stored_vuln.php`)
- 🔐 Two secure endpoints (`reflected_safe.php` and `stored_safe.php`)
- 🧪 Simple frontend with forms for testing
